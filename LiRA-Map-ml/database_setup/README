These scripts are used to update the friction database that lies on the server se2-A.compute.dtu.dk from the DTU university. 
The scripts query data from the lira database that includes all data used so far for the LiRA project. Then the data is used to calculate new
road conditions values such as the friction. These calculations are then uploaded into a new database.
